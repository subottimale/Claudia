Plates for builds that will use 3-pin switches or just prefer the aesthetic.

If you won't be using a base plate, the no-screw version is recommended. Holes align with the base plate mounting holes in the pcb.

This example is using 3mm thicc plates with screw holes (hopefully you can't miss where they're called out). 3mm is the max recommended thickness for a full plate, or you risk interfering with the diodes.
