These cases are PCB top mount (plateless), in keeping with the goal of maintaining the lowest possible profile

The Choc version has a slightly lower overall profile and thumb cluster cutouts. Recommended hardware is self-tapping M2

Big thanks to Drew... for creating another excellent top-mount case option https://github.com/drewfowler/Drew...-Open-Source-Projects
